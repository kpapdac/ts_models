Time-series models

This repo will predict future foreign exchange rates and answer questions like:
- how interdependent currencies are. Can one currency change drive appreciation/depreciation on another?
- if yes, what are the most dominant pairs
- can these preditions be used to recommend more efficient market trading and buy/sell at the right time?
